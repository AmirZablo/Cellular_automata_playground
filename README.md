# Conway's Game of Life
Just run /python3 game_of_life.py and enjoy!

Python implementation of the famous cellular automata, with an user-friendly graphical interface. 

Rules:

1- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
